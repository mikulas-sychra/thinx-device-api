IoT Device Management Server running on node.js.


## The Purpose

> Update IoT device by pushing to a git repository. Swap operating system for another over-the-air. Migrate multiple devices at once between WiFi networks.

As a user I have already many IoT new and/or legacy devices at home and new platforms are coming every day.

Sometimes we need to change WiFi credentials on a wireless switch mounted on a ceiling. The other day I we want to swap whole firmware for new one, but not always to rewrite working legacy LUA or Micropython code to Platformio.

It also covers other use-cases like remotely managing devices for customers with automatic updates for headless devices, or semi-automatic (with user consent after build and tests succed).

> That's why we have decided to create the uber-platform: THiNX.

Currently we're capable of building firmwares for Platformio, NodeMCU and Micropython (and simple Arduino firmware is also coming soon)

* Remote Things Management console for monitoring devices, attaching source code and managing updates.

* Implements Continuous Integration practices to update device apps/configurations from a GitHub repository using commit hooks.

* Helps building secure MQTT infrastructure as an optional side-chain transport layer.

* Serves as an IoT device registration endpoint while storing device data using CouchDB server and Redis session-store.

* API is a back-end data provider (security agent) for RTM Admin Console Application.

* Provides control to a dockerized build servers and pushes new firmware versions to client applications (FCM push) and devices (MQTT).

* Provides HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy to secure legacy IoT devices that are not capable of TLS and/or AES-level encryption.

* Allows transfer of device ownership (e.g. for pre-configured devices).

* Custom firmware builder for MongooseOS, NodeMCU and Micropython (allow module selection, add THiNX as an OS-level library)

* Transfer device to another owner along with sources/firmware.


## Supported IoT Platforms

* ESP8266 (thinx-firmware-esp8266)

* Tested on Wemos D1 Mini, Wemos D1 Mini Pro, RobotDyn D1, RobotDyn D1 Mini, RobotDyn MEGA WiFi and various NodeMCU (Lolin, AI-THINKER) boards with Arduino, LUA and Micropython-based core firmwares

* Expected: Arduino with networking support, MongooseOS-based devices...

THiNX Platform Library repositories:

[Platform.io](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-pio)

[Arduino](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-ino)

[NodeMCU/LUA](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-lua)

[Micropython](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-upy)

[MongooseOS](https://github.com/suculent/thinx-firmware-esp8266-mos)


## Custom Firmwares

With built-in THiNX Client Library:

[NodeMCU/LUA](https://github.com/suculent/nodemcu-firmware)

[Micropython](https://github.com/suculent/nodemcu-micropython)

Arduino, Plaform.io and MongooseOS are firmwares by nature.


## Dockerized Firmware Builders

[PlatformIO](https://github.com/suculent/platformio-docker-build)

[Arduino](https://github.com/suculent/arduino-docker-build)

[MongooseOS](https://github.com/suculent/mongooseos-docker-build)

[NodeMCU/LUA](https://github.com/suculent/nodemcu-docker-build/)

[Micropython](https://github.com/suculent/micropython-docker-build/)


## Prerequisites

* Linux Server (min. 2 GB RAM, 32GB SSD)
* Docker

## Port mapping

* API runs on HTTP port 7442 (possibly HTTPS 7443) and 7447 (websocket)
* MQTT runs on HTTP port 1883 (possibly HTTPS 8883)
* Admin runs on HTTP/HTTPS port (80/443)
* GitHub commit hooks are listened to on port 9000, 9001
* Optional monitoring services (Keymetrics, TrueSight) may run on other ports as well...

## Installation

### Using Docker

Experimental Docker installation can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/r/suculent/thinx-docker/](Docker Hub).

First of all, set a valid FQDN for your new THiNX instance on your DNS server. Use this FQDN to parametrize the Docker image:

    docker pull suculent/thinx-docker

    docker build --build-arg THINX_HOSTNAME=staging.thinx.cloud -t suculent/thinx-docker .

    docker run -ti -e THINX_HOSTNAME='staging.thinx.cloud' -e THINX_OWNER='suculent@me.com' suculent/thinx-docker

### Installing Platform Builders

Attach to the running container with bash:

```
docker run -ti -e THINX_HOSTNAME='staging.thinx.cloud' -e THINX_OWNER='suculent@me.com' suculent/thinx-docker /bin/bash

```

Fetch required builder images from Docker Hub:

```
bash ./install-builders.sh
```


## GitHub Webhook support

You can direct your GitHub webhooks to https://thinx.cloud:9001/ after adding a valid deploy key from GitHub to THiNX RTM.


## Endpoints

See 03-test.sh. There is no point of maintaining documentation for this at current stage of development and user base zero.


# Platforms State of Union

### PlatformIO

* We need to take care of corret spelling for PlatformIO (and Git as well).
* Docker builder works. Deployment update can be tested now.

### Arduino

* Docker builder works in specified workdir.
* Deployment update can be tested now.

### NodeMCU

* File-based update has been pre-tested. Docker builder works fine but needs tighter integration with sources (workdir).
* Deployment is not verified, therefore update cannot be tested.
* There's currently no known test-device but many actually in production.

### Micropython

* Docker builder works fine but needs tighter integration with sources.
* Deployment is not verified, therefore update cannot be tested now.


# Roadmap

* test e2e pio update
* test e2e ino update
* test lua build + inject + e2e
* test upy build + inject + e2e
* test mos build + develop library + e2e
